# Silkworm-gender-prediction

This project is a web-based AI tool that predicts silkworm gender using cocoon size, weight, texture, and color intensity. It uses a Random Forest model trained on sample data, provides predictions through a Flask web interface, and displays feature importance and accuracy for easy analysis. Key Features: ML Model with Random Forest: Uses physical features: COCOON SIZE, WEIGHT, TEXTURE, COLOR INTENSITY. Generates target labels (gender: Male/Female) automatically using a rule-based threshold. Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict silkworm gender. Evaluates performance with accuracy score and confusion matrix. Visualizes feature importance to show which attributes influence predictions the most. Web Interface (Flask + HTML/JS): Provides a simple, user-friendly form to input silkworm features. Sends input data to the Flask backend via JSON. Returns predicted gender as Male or Female.

Persistence: Trained ML model is saved as vibrasense_model.pkl using pickle, enabling reuse without retraining.

Visualizations: Confusion matrix and feature importance plots help analyze model behavior.
